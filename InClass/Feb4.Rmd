## Linear Algebra

```{r example}
r <- c(1,3,5)
r
```
r is a vector, where r(t) = [x(t), y(t), z(t)] = x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k


```{r basis vectors}
x <- c(1,5,7)
b1 <- c(1,0,2)
b2 <- c(0,3,2)
```
here, we will project the information given from the vector/variable x onto the basis vectors b1 and b2


Proj[b1 X b2](x) = A * (t(A)*A)^(-1) * t(A) * x

```{r}
A <- matrix(c(b1,b2), ncol=2)

matrix.inverse(t(A) %*% A)

A %*% matrix.inverse(t(A) %*% A) %*% t(A) %*% x
```
given a projections v1 and v2, we can see by comparing them to x that we lost some information (as planned =D) and were able to do so in an intellegent fashion
