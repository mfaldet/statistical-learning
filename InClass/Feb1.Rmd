## Linear Algebra

```{r example}
r <- c(1,3,5)
r
```
r is a vector, where r(t) = [x(t), y(t), z(t)] = x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k

```{r basis vectors}
x <- c(1,5,7)
b1 <- c(1,0,2)
b2 <- c(0,3,2)
```
here, we will project the information given from the vector/variable x onto the basis vectors b1 and b2

```{r dot product}
v1 <- (t(x) %*% b1)/(t(b1) %*% b1) * b1
v2 <- (t(x-v1) %*% b2)/(t(b2) %*% b2) * b2

v1
v2
v1+v2
x-(v1+v2)

```
given a projections v1 and v2, we can see by comparing them to x that we lost some information (as planned =D) and were able to do so in an intellegent fashion

```{r}
A <- matrix(c(b1,b2), ncol=2)

A %*% matrix.inverse(t(A) %*% A) %*% t(A) %*% x
```
